# Triangle

### Skills: Object Oriented Programming

## Instructions

Write a `Triangle` class that accepts its sides on initialization. Give your Triangles an instance method, `kind` that returns, as a symbol, its type. The valid types are:

1. `:equilateral`

2. `:isosceles`

3. `:scalene`

Make the tests pass!

## Hint

The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle always exceeds the length of the third side. This is a principle known as the _triangle inequality_.

## Building and Raising a Custom Error

You will need to raise a custom error type in order to make the bonus tests pass. Here is some helpful reading:
